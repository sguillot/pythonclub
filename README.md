# Python Club at the Institute of Astrophysics

This repository contains the data and code developed by the Python Club at the Institute of Astrophysics at PUC.

We will meet every two **Wednesday at 5 pm** in the Seminar room. The moderators will be Josh Tan, Roberto Mu√±oz and Marcelo Mora. The Python Club will mostly consits of hands-on tutorials and everyone can volunteer to give one.

The folders will be organised in the following way

* sessions: Contain all the Jupyter notebooks and data we will use during the hands-on sessions.
* user_scripts: Contain small programs and pieces of code by the Python Club users. Anything you think it's useful just put it here. Use you username as the folder name.
* projects: Contain more elaborated programs you already started and want to develop during the Python club. We expect some of this projects becoming repositories in the future.

If you want to start preparing a notebook for explaing the usage of some library, let's say Matplotlib, go ahead and create the folder XX-matplotlib inside sessions.

All the code hosted in the Python Club should fulfill the **GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3**. For more information, read the file LICENSE
